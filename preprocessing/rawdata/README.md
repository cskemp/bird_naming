## Folk taxonomies coded by Eric Holman

Holman, Eric W., 2017, "Folk and Scientific Classifications of Animals and Plants (M790V1)", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/EOPJYH, Harvard Dataverse, V2

which accompanies the following paper.

Holman, Eric W. "The relation between folk and scientific classification of plants and animals." Journal of Classification 19.1 (2002): 131-159.

The original data file and codebook (included here) are `DTA900.file4787.ANIMALS.R2DAT.TXT` and `DTA900.file4788.ANIMALS.R2.PDF`.  I manually created files for the seven cultures by extracting subsets from the original data file. Each subset is intended to include only birds.
